Anaconda: Distribution of Python
-- has many Python libraries inside

Jupyter
-- IDE for Data Science

Code in this Udemy Course works in any IDE, not just Jupyter

Steps for Running "Anaconda Navigator"
Note: Because "Anaconda" installer only works for Mac with an Apple chip (I have a Mac with an Intel chip), I had to download Miniconda, then since the Python version was a mismatch, I had to open a new environment with the correct Python version and install Anaconda in there. So, to run Anaconda and Anaconda Navigator etc., I need to open that environment first.
>> conda activate navigator (enter the environment named "navigator" (I chose that name))
>> anaconda-navigator

Steps for Running "Jupyter"
1. Do all steps for running "Anaconda Navigator"
2. Then, click "Launch" for Jupyter in the UI
3. To see Jupyter, open the following link in the browser
>> http://localhost:8888/tree
OR
>> conda activate navigator (enter the environment named "navigator" (I chose that name))
>> jupyter lab (it opens this url: "http://localhost:8890/lab")

-- Note: If Jupyter doesn't work on my Mac, use "Google Colab". So far, Jupyter works on my Mac, so I haven't tried "Google Colab", but this is good to know.

To install, you can do
-- pip install numpy <- What I usually use
-- conda install numpy <- What I'll use in this course since I'm using Anaconda to manage these packages

pip install matplotlib
or
conda install matplotlib
<- conda is needed for Jupyter Lab (since Jupyet Lab is run from the Anaconda set of packages)


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


In 1st cell:
%matplotlib inline


Creating a Plot/Graph:
fig1 = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig1.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])
ax1.plot(x, y)
ax1.set_ylabel('y')
ax1.set_xlabel('title')
plt.show()

Showing a Figure in Jupyter Labs
###############################################################

plt.show()  # <- Works for right after creating

Note: It's best to put all of the commands/code for each figure/chart/graph in the same cell - otherwise, you might run into problems. Below (in this section) are details if you want to try anyway.


The "%matplotlib inline" should have gotten Jupyter Labs to automaticalluy show each plot once its set up, but, for my laptop, it doesn't automatically show.




To Show the Graph Created in Other Cells
(and yes, you can also reference, update, etc. the graph in other cells)

Type the name of the figure object that the graph/plot was created with.
Ex: Let's use the graph and its "parent" figure listed above:
fig1
Yes, that's it. Just write the name of the figure, which in this case is "fig1"


#############################################################
Plots do NOT clear when you re-run Cells
#############################################################

Plot/canvas does NOT clear if you run the same cell multiple times -it just draws over.
So if you had it draw 1 line, and then run the cell again after telling it to plot a different line, it will still keep the old one.
It's recommended for you to declare/creat ethe figure object in the same cell that you create the axes objects and draw/plot the lines. That would solve this and other issues.

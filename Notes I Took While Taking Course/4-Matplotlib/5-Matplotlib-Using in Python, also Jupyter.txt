pip install matplotlib
or
conda install matplotlib
<- conda is needed for Jupyter Lab (since Jupyet Lab is run from the Anaconda set of packages)


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


In 1st cell:
%matplotlib inline


Creating a Plot/Graph:
fig1 = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig1.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])
ax1.plot(x, y)
ax1.set_ylabel('y')
ax1.set_xlabel('title')
plt.show()


Showing a Figure i

The "%matplotlib inline" should have gotten Jupyter Labs to automaticalluy show each plot once its set up, but, for my laptop, it doesn't automatically show.


plt.show()  # <- Works for right after creating

To Show the Graph Created in Other Cells
(and yes, you can also reference, update, etc. the graph in other cells)

Type the name of the figure object that the graph/plot was created with.
Ex: Let's use the graph and its "parent" figure listed above:
fig1
Yes, that's it. Just write the name of the figure, which in this case is "fig1"

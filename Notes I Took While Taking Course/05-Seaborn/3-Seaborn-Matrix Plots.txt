Seaborn - Matrix Plots

Corr
##################################################

.corr stands for "Correlates/Correlating etc.


tips.corr()
# matrix
# A Table, showing how each numerical value correlate with eaech other
Value = 1.00 means that the values line up perfectly
So when a column is compared to itself, as seen in the diagonal rows from top left to bottom right, it will have value = 1.00

tips.corr():
            total_bill   tip     size
total_bill      1.00     0.67    0.59
tip             0.67     1.00    0.48
size            0.59     0.48    1.00

HeatMap
##################################################

sns.heatmap(tips.corr()):

Heatmap colors in those values into a grid pattern based on a gradient scale.

annot
# Stands for Annotations
# Optional
# Writes the numbers in each of heatmap's cells

cmap
# Stands for Color Map (which color gradient you want to use  to color in the heat)
# Optional

sns.heatmap(tips.corr(), annot = True, cmap = ):



flights.pivot_table(index = 'month', columns = 'year', values = 'passengers')

sns.heatmap(flights.pivot_table(index = 'month', columns = 'year', values = 'passengers'))

You can see heatmap based on that pivoted table, so you cna easily tell which month of which year had the most flights


Let's add arguments.


sns.heatmap(flights.pivot_table(index = 'month', columns = 'year', values = 'passengers'), cmap = 'magma', linecolor = 'white' , linewidths = 1)
# Easy to see dark-to-light 
# linecolor, linewidths <-Can add lines between each cell on your heatmap

Cluster Maps
##################################################


sns.clustermap(flights.pivot_table(index = 'month', columns = 'year', values = 'passengers'))

The X and Y Axises Ranges are now NOT in order
They are clustered by similarity.
-- The X Axis (Years) are not in order
-- The Y Axis (Months) are not in order
Instead, months with similar # of flights are clustered together
and years with similar # of flights are clustered together
So it's easier for you which months have similar flight amounts to each other., which years have similar amounts to each other etc.

Looks like a heatmap but there are also brackets (like March Madness Brackets) attached to/drawn outside of the heatmap, trying to describe which columns/rows values have more similarity


sns.clustermap(flights.pivot_table(index = 'month', columns = 'year', values = 'passengers'), cmap = 'coolwarm', standard_scale = 1)

standard_scale
= 0  # refers to rows
= 1  # refers to columns

"standardize" the values for each cell.
Meaning, for each cell do this
 value - minimum/maximum

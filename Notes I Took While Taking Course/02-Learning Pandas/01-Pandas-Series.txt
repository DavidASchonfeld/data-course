Pandas - Series

-- Similar to numpy array. What makes series different?
Note: Panda's series are built off of a numpy array
-- a series can be indexed by a label (and a numpy array cannot)

A Pandas Series datatype could be int, string, functions, etc.

4 Separate Python Objects - Inefficient
labels = ['a','b','c']
my_data = [10,20,30]
arr = np.array(my_data)
my_dictionary = {'a':10, 'b':20, 'c':30}

Let's Make a Series
import pandas as pd

--I can pass in a
---- Python Array
---- Numpy Array
---- Python Dictionary

pd.Series(data = my_data)
pd.Series(data = my_data, index=labels) or since the parameters I'm putting into these parenthes are in order, I can do
pd.Series(my_data,labels)
I could also pass in an numpy array
pd.Series(data = arr, index=labels)

pd.Series(my_dictionary)

pd.Series(data=labels)

Passing in fucntions for Pandas an example:pd.Series(data=[sum,print,len])

pd.Series works like a dictionary/hashtable

series_1 = pd.Series([1,2,3,4],['USA','Japan','India','China'])
series_2 = pd.Series([1,2,5,4], ['USA', 'Japan','Italy','China'])
series_3 = pd.Series([1,2,3,4], [0,1,2,3])

get value like a Python dictionary:
series_1['USA'] would give me 1
Remember, here, the index is the string and the value is the number.
If the index was a number, I would pass in a number, and then get the value for that dictionary slot (in this case, the series's slot)
Ex: series_3[0]


series_1+series_2  # <-Element-by-Element, add each element together based on the index. AND converts all integers into floats in case we miss anything if we decide to divide numbers.

If at least one series has NO matching index, it will report NaN
For example:
series_1+series_2: Result:
USA    2.0
Japan  4.0
India  NaN
Italy  NaN
China  8.0

NumpPy Operations

# Remember to Import Nunmpy to use it
import nump as np
#

arr = np.arange(0,11) : [Remember, inclusive start, exclusive end]

Combining/etc. Arrays on an Element-by-Element Basic
-- Element-by-Element: Combining/etc. each pair of elements at the same index for each of the arrays. For example, array A, slot 0 and array B, slot 0 will be combined/etc. to put in array Result, slot 0.

-- arr_1 + arr_2: Adds element-by-element
-- arr_1 - arr_2: Subtracts element-by-element
-- arr_1 * arr_2: Multiples element-by-element
-- arr**2 (array to the power of 2, aka squaring each element): element-by-element 

Also works for Broadcasting. also element-by-element:
arr + 100: Adds 100 to each value, aka to each slot
arr - 100
arr * 100

Sometimes, numpy puts out Warnings intstead of Errors for certain situations
In Python: 1/0: ZeroDivisionError
arr = array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
arr / arr: In this example: arr has a 0 value, in the 0th index slot, we are dividing 0/0, which is a math error.) In numpy, it gives a RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide and still outputs an answer.
"nan" = non-applicable number

Result: array([nan, 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])
In this case, in the slot for the 0/0 result, it has "nan"

for a 1/0, you get
"inf" = infinity
Result: array[ inf, 1. , 0.5, 0.33, 0.25, 0.2, 0.16, 0.14, 0.125, 0.1, 0.1] I (shorted the numbers to make it easier to type here)


Universal Array Functions:

np.sqrt(arr)  <-that does elemet-by-element taking the square root
[1.00000, 2.71, 7.3, 2.]

np.max(arr): Get the value that has the highest value
arr.max()  <-does same thing as above

np.sin(arr): Pass every element into the sin function.
np.log(arr): Pass every element into the log: 
--If you do log(0), you get -1*infinity.

More Universal Functions: Google numpy Operations or numpy Universal Operations etc.

Before creating your own function, make sure to see if numpy already built a function for you to use (like the np.log(arr), for example)

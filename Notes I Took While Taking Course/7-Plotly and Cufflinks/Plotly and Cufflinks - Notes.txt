Plotly and Cufflinks 


####################################
Intro
####################################


Plotly: interactive visualization library, open-source
Cufflinks: connects plotly with Pandas


To Install:
pip install plotly
pip install cufflinks

(During the time the lecturer recorded this lecture, you could not use "conda install plotly" and "conda install cufflinks" at this time. But now (January 2026) you can.)

Note: Plotly is free. You only pay money if you want plotly to host your data etc., but you can host it on your own server, or run it locally if you like for free (or pay for your own 3rd party hosting etc.)


# This class will focus on using Plotly with Pandas (and Cufflinks connects those together).


### Update Notes:
Since this lecture was posted, new errors/features for Plotly and Cufflinks were put out, so there is a note in the lecture area with notes/required additional code needed to get Plotly and Cufflinks to work.
I will need to add this also here, and also in the worksheet.
He also notes: If you run into problems, search the course Q&A section before posting new questions in the Q&A section.'


pip install chart-studio

In the Python File:
import chart_studio.plotly as py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from plotly import __version__

print(__version__)

Note: I will use Jupyter Notebook for taking notes for this, to ensure that when I write the notes form the lecturer, I immediately correcet it with more up-to-date information.




TODO: According to my research (I will post/message the lecturer):
my_dataFrame_1.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'A', y = 'B', s = 20)  #<- "s": makes smaller circles, # = for area, Matplotlib
VS
my_dataFrame_1.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'A', y = 'B').update_traces(marker=dict(size = 20)), #<- size: makes larger circles, # refers to diameter, Plotly
Is this true? Which should I use (or should I use a different method for accessing "size" and similar parameters?) If this lecture is about teaching me to use Plotly,

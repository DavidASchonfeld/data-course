Also, includes notes via the SF Salaries Exercise.


ORDER BY
my_dataFrame.sort_values(
    by = ["Column1", "Column2"]
    ascending = [False, True]
)


my_dataFrame.head()
--gets top 4 rows plus the column/row names etc.
--You can specify by putting in:
my_dataFrame.head(2)
to get the top 2 rows plus the column/row names etc.

--------------
WHERE (equivalent to SQL WHERE):

---------
SELECT * FROM salaryTable WHERE EmployeeName = "JOSEPH DRISCOLL"
-- "*" Means Select (aka show/display/return) all columns

Pandas Equivalent:
salaryTable[salaryTable['EmployeeName'] == "JOSEPH DRISCOLL"]
----------
SELECT JobTitle FROM salaryTable WHERE EmployeeName = "JOSEPH DRISCOLL"

Pandas Equivalent:
salaryTable[salaryTable['EmployeeName] == "JOSEPH DRISCOLL"]["JobTitle"]

--- Highest Paid Person in the Salary Table:
sal[sal['TotalPay'] == sal['TotalPay'].max()]
Another Way:
sal['TotalPayBenefits'].idxmax()
Note: .idxmax() is similar to .argmax in NumPy
Find the entry with the highest value based on the column

I could also do
sal.iloc[sal['TotalPayBenefits'].argmax()]

Reminder:
Navigating DataFrames in Pandas:
my_dataFrame["byColumnName"].loc["byRowName"]


------ Find Person with Lowest Salary
sal[sal['TotalPay'] == sal['TotalPay'].min()]

same as:
sal.iloc[sal['TotalPayBenefits].argmin()]

------- # of Unique Job Titles:
(sal.groupby(by = "JobTitle")["JobTitle"].count()).count()
To Break This Down:
sal.groupby(by = "JobTitle")["JobTitle"].count() is a DataFrame with a list of each job and how many people have that specifically worded job. Then, we add a ().count around that to count all of those numbers together to get a total number of rows: how many job titles were listed
Equivalent Result to doing this: 
sal['JobTitle'].nunique()  <- To get # of unique values in that specified column

Top 5 Most Common Jobs
sal['JobTitle'].value_counts.head(5)


--How many Job Titles where only 1 Person had that Job Title in 2013?
sum(sal[sal['Year'] == 2013]['JobTitle'].value_counts == 1)
# This outputs 
sal[sal['Year'] == 2013]['JobTitle'].value_counts == 1
# This outputs a list like:

No Headers but if it had headers:
JobTitle   True/False if the JobTitle has instance value == 1 in the sal table
JobTitle    True

True/False list - True for the rows with Column Value 'JobTitle' count == 1
Let's sum it all up to count

--Table Comparing Job Title String and Salary:

sal['title_len'] = sal['JobTitle'].apply(len)  # Creating New Column Based on JobTitle's String Length
sal[['JobTitle','title_len']]  # Outputs the 2 columns 'JobTitle' and 'title_len' (including Column Titles/Names and the Indexes of each Row)

sal[['title_len','TotalPayBenefits']].corr()
# .corr() returns the correlation between 2 columns
A 1.0 value means that the values are perfectly correlated.

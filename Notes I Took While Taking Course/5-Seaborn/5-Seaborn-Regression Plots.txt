Seaborn - Regression Plots


# Seaborn has many regression plots, but we won't really be discussing regression until the Machine Learning section of this course.

import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
tips.head()

sns.lmplot(x = 'total_bill', y = 'tip', data = tips)
# It's a scatter plot, with a linear fit on top of it


Let's add hue to separate based on category.

sns.lmplot(x = 'total_bill', y = 'tip', data = tips, hue = 'sex')
Since we are setting hue = gender,
now there are 2 overlaping scatterplots/linear fits (one per sex), color-coded by the category (sex)

We use the same parameters as matplotlib
For example:
markers = []
# Since we are using hue (to show 2 different plots based on the different values in 1 category column), we need to pass in a list of marker shapes instead of just one marker shape

sns.lmplot(x = 'total_bil', y = 'tip', data = tips, hue = 'sex', markers = ['o', 'v'])
-- Now upside triangles for females, circles for males.
Lets's make the dots larger

matplotlib parameters into the plt scatter thing

Seaborn sns.lmplot is calling matplotlib under the hood
This is a case-by-case basis depending on type of graph you are choosing
sns.lmplot(x = 'total_bil'', y = 'tip', data = tips, hue = 'sex', markers = ['o', 'v'], scatter_kws={'s': 100})

We could add more
sns.lmplot(x = 'total_bil', y = 'tip', data = tips, col = 'sex')
# Now we have 2 separate side-by-side graphs, 1 for each sex value (male, female)

sns.lmplot(x = 'total_bil', y = 'tip', data = tips, col = 'sex', row = 'time')
Now we have a 2-by-2 table of 4 graphs

time = Lunch, sex = Male    time = Lunch, sex = Female

time = Dinner, sex = Male   time = Dinner, sex = Female




sns.lmplot(x = 'total_bil', y = 'tip', data = tips, col = 'sex', aspect = 0.6, size = 8)
-- Only col parameter but no row perimeter means there will only be 1 row of multiple graphs, side-by-side
-- "aspect": aka "Aspect Ratio: Height VS Width drawing, applies to each grid. 0.6 means taller/skinnier graph
-- "size": Size

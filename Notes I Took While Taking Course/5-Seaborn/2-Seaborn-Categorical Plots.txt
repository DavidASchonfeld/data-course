Seaborn - Categorical Plots

import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
tips.head()

import numpy as np

####################################################
Bar Plot
####################################################
sns.barplot()

## Agreggate data based on a function

sns.barplot(x = 'sex', y = 'total_bill', data = tips, estimator = np.std)
# Category, Numerical Column, Data, Funciton that computers the average/estimator for each category 
# Shows all data sorted into bars based on sex,
then the y = average tip based on what each gender is tipping

estimator:
    "callable that maps vector -> scalar, optional,
    "statistical funciton to estimate within each categorical bin" (quote from the function description)
# By default, it is the mean (aka the average)
Passing in np.std means it will instead take the standard deviantion


sns.countplot(x = 'sex', data = tips)
# counts the occurences for each value
# similar to Pandas.counts via the category I put in
# the y is automatically chosen as the count #

Box Plot
also known as "Box and Whisker Plot"


sns.boxplot(x = 'day', y = 'total_bill', data = tips, hue = 'smoker')
x = categorical
y = number
# box: core tiles of the data distribution
# whiskers show rest of data distribution
# dots outside of whiskers are the data outliers

# hue: optional parameter
# If you choose it, it colors in and creates different boxes for each category (in this case, day), each colored differently, with a key to say what each color says

Violin Plots
####################################################
sns.violinplot(x = 'day', y = 'total_bill', data = tips, hue = 'sex', split = True)
Very similar to box plot.
Allows us to show kernel density of the distribution
A lot more information about disturbitunop of all, but less info since it has no whiskers and shows where the most points are located etc.

Yes, hue is possible here
Hue is optional
Shows 2 violin plots next to each other in each category. You could also do 
Split
(Default is False)
Make it true + Hue: Each Violin shape is split in half based on the category, so it's much easier to compare the 2 categories together (sex) in each day slot.

You have to know which graph/visualization that your audience wants.


####################################################
Strip Plot
####################################################

sns.stripplot(x = 'day', y = 'total_bill', data = tips)

"essentially a scatter plot based on a category" quote from the lecturer
Strip Plot Flaw: You can't tell how many points are stacked on top of each other. To fix that, add the Jitter Parameter. Adds a little random noise to left/right to spread out the points a bit so you can hopefully see better where there are more/less data points

sns.stripplot(x = 'day', y = 'total_bill', data = tips, jitter = True)

You can add hues to have color-coded dots based on a category.
sns.stripplot(x = 'day', y = 'total_bill', data = tips, jitter = True, hue = 'sex')

You can do "split" like with a violin plot, splitting each category into 2 separate areas, each for the area with a different category
sns.stripplot(x = 'day', y = 'total_bill', data = tips, jitter = True, hue = 'sex', split = True)

Plotly and Cufflinks 


####################################
Intro
####################################


Plotly: interactive visualization library, open-source
Cufflinks: connects plotly with Pandas


To Install:
pip install plotly
pip install cufflinks

(During the time the lecturer recorded this lecture, you could not use "conda install plotly" and "conda install cufflinks" at this time. But now (January 2026) you can.)

Note: Plotly is free. You only pay money if you want plotly to host your data etc., but you can host it on your own server, or run it locally if you like for free (or pay for your own 3rd party hosting etc.)


# This class will focus on using Plotly with Pandas (and Cufflinks connects those together).


### Update Notes:
Since this lecture was posted, new errors/features for Plotly and Cufflinks were put out, so there is a note in the lecture area with notes/required additional code needed to get Plotly and Cufflinks to work.
I will need to add this also here, and also in the worksheet.
He also notes: If you run into problems, search the course Q&A section before posting new questions in the Q&A section.'


pip install chart-studio

In the Python File:
import chart_studio.plotly as py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from plotly import __version__

print(__version__)

Note: I will use Jupyter Notebook for taking notes for this, to ensure that when I write the notes form the lecturer, I immediately correcet it with more up-to-date information.




TODO: According to my research (I will post/message the lecturer):
my_dataFrame_1.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'A', y = 'B', s = 20)  #<- "s": makes smaller circles, # = for area, Matplotlib
VS
my_dataFrame_1.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'A', y = 'B').update_traces(marker=dict(size = 20)), #<- size: makes larger circles, # refers to diameter, Plotly
Is this true? Which should I use (or should I use a different method for accessing "size" and similar parameters?) If this lecture is about teaching me to use Plotly, which method should I use/how should I learn from this?

Question for Lecturer/Teaching Assistants:

Subject: Plotly Parameters


While following the lecture, even with recommended changes via the document, I could not get iplot to work.

So I made the .plot() method use Plotly (got information from other Q&A from this lecture/course) (Code is included at the bottom of this post)

Because of this, I had trouble implementing certain parameters that the lecturer used.

I have 2 questions about this:
Note: My Full Setup Code (list of imports, mode I turned on etc.) is at the bottom of this post)
Note: I have researched my questions extensively and am continuing to try to solve this on my own as well.

1. Which Method (Below) is Best/Ideal? Is what I wrote (one still uses Matplotlib, one uses Plotly) accurate? Which should I use (or should I use a different method for accessing "size" and similar parameters?) I also see "Plotly Express" being mentioned. How does that factor in? If this lecture is about teaching me to use Plotly, which method should I use/how should I learn from this? 

Note: Both of these methods work and create interactive graphs, though 1 draws smaller markers than the other.
my_dataFrame_1.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'A', y = 'B', s = 20)  #<- "s": makes smaller circles, # = for area, (Matplotlib)
VS
my_dataFrame_1.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'A', y = 'B').update_traces(marker=dict(size = 20)), #<- size: makes larger circles, # refers to diameter, (Plotly)
Is this true? 

2. I cannot get the parameter   mode = "marker"   to work at all. Since my scatter graph, by default, show the markers, this is not necessary. But I am still wondering how to access/set that parameter, and how it fits into how to use Plotly the right way.

# Setup From Lecture (I added the comments)

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from plotly import __version__
import cufflinks as cf
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot
init_notebook_mode(connected = True)  # Connects JavaScript to the Notebook
cf.go_offline()  # Allows us to use Cufflinks offline
##
# Extra Setup from Q&A Section in this lecture (since I couldn't get iplot() to work

import chart_studio.plotly as py
pd.options.plotting.backend = 'plotly'
from chart_studio.plotly import plot
##

# Plot Method:
my_dataFrame_1.plot()  # Plots with Plotly
# Now it's a mouseover interactive

my_dataFrame_1.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'A', y = 'B', s = 20)
OR
my_dataFrame_1.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'A', y = 'B').update_traces(marker=dict(size = 20))

ANOTHER Question for Lecturer/Teaching Assistants:

Subject Line: Iplot: Works Inconsistently?
Subject: Iplot doesn't work in Plotly/Cufflinks section, but works in Choropleth/Geographical Mapping Section

I appreciate this course and I am learning a fair amouint and am excited to learn more.
I am confused about the iplot method, and when it is supposed to work/not work and whether parts are deprecated or not.
(Note: I have googled this and am still confused, and I will continue to try to find the answer.)

When following the Plotly/Cufflinks lecture/section, I was unable to get the iplot method to work.
However, when I was in the following section focusing on Choropleth/Geographical Mapping, I was able to use iplot.
Does iplot only work in certain modes? Is iplot deprecated? And is Cufflinks deprecated (via this Q&A from this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/5733376#questions/23887269) Or perhaps I am using iplot incorrectly? How can I use iplot correctly the right way?




Plotly/Cufflinks Section: How I tried (and failed) to use iplot

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from plotly import __version__
import cufflinks as cf
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot
init_notebook_mode(connected = True)  # Connects JavaScript to the Notebook
cf.go_offline()  # Allows us to use Cufflinks offline
# DATA
my_dataFrame_1 = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(100, 4), columns = 'A B C D'.split())
my_dataFrame_1.head()

my_dataFrame_1.iplot()  # <- Does Not Work


Choropleth/Geographical Mapping Section (This "iplot" works): 

import pandas as pd

# import plotly.plotly as py <-Deprecated line
import plotly.graph_objs as go  #<-This is especially needed for Plotly graphs
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot

#############
## I included this because according to some Q&As in the Plotly section, I need this in more recent versions to get Plotly to work.

import chart_studio.plotly as py
pd.options.plotting.backend = 'plotly'
from chart_studio.plotly import plot


init_notebook_mode(connected = True)  # Enable to see things in JupyterNotebook

##3 USA Map

data = dict(type = 'choropleth',
           locations = ['AZ','CA','NY'],
           locationmode = 'USA-states',
            # locationmode: We're choosing one of the preset strings that plotly gives as an option
            colorscale = 'Greens',
            text = ['Arizona', 'Cali', 'New York'],  # text appears when hovering over
            z  = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], # Values that colormap will use for the color gradient
            colorbar = {'title':'Colorbar Title'}
           )

layout = dict(geo  = {'scope':'usa'})

choromap = go.Figure(data = [data], layout = layout)
iplot(choromap)  # <- This works in creating an interactive map.
